[![company logo generator that uses Polygon (formerly Matic) to mint a business logo as an NFT:

This contract allows users to generate a unique business logo by calling the generateLogo function and sending the required payment in Ether. The logo is generated based on a hash of the current block timestamp, difficulty, and the sender's address. The hash is then stored as a mapping to the corresponding NFT token ID.

The maxSupply variable sets the maximum number of logos that can be minted. Once the maximum supply is reached, no more logos can be generated. The withdraw function allows the contract owner to withdraw any funds held in the contract.

To use this contract, you would need to deploy it to the Polygon (formerly Matic) blockchain and set the desired price and maxSupply values. Then, users can call the generateLogo function to mint a unique logo as an NFT on the Polygon network.
